        <p>
          When I'm not working, I enjoy going to the gym and lifting weights.<br>
          My focus in the gym currently is more body building style but I also<br>
          Enjoy powerlifting as well.

        <p>
            In my downtime I enjoy playing video games with my friends. Video games like;<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Enshrouded</li>
                <li>Palworld</li>
                <li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</li>
            </ul>
            Video games have been a hobby of mine since I was 16. They help me disconnect<br>
            And relax.

        <p>
            The most fun and important thing I enjoy doing the most is being a father.<br>
            My daugher was the best thing to happen to me. Every day is cherished and<br>
            An adventure with her. I love to play wrestle with her, swing her around,<br>
            Tickle her, and snuggle with her. She's my motivation to do my best.
